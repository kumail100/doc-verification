AI-Powered Secure Document Verification System on BitcoinSV

Project Overview: “AI-Powered Secure Document Verification System on BitcoinSV”
Problem It Solves:
This app uses AI to digitally verify documents (e.g., contracts, certificates) using machine learning models for document classification, ensuring their validity. It then stores and tracks their verification details (hashes, metadata) on the BitcoinSV blockchain using the sCrypt contract for secure and tamper-proof storage.

Use Cases:
Education: Verifying diplomas or certificates issued by institutions.
Legal: Authenticating contracts or legal documents.
Business: Storing records of verified documents to ensure transparency and traceability.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: Vue.js or React.js
Backend: Python (Flask) for AI processing + Node.js (sCrypt interaction)
Blockchain: BitcoinSV (via sCrypt for smart contracts)
AI: TensorFlow or OpenCV for document verification and classification
Key Features:
AI-Powered Document Verification:

AI model classifies whether the document matches expected formats (e.g., diploma, contract).
Uses NLP to extract metadata from documents for further validation.
Blockchain-Backed Verification Record:

Uses BitcoinSV and sCrypt smart contracts to store a tamper-proof hash of the document, along with verification metadata, on the blockchain.
Allows users to retrieve the verification data at any point to prove its authenticity.
User-Friendly UI:

Upload documents, get real-time feedback on the authenticity/verification of the document.
Store verification details on-chain with blockchain transaction details available for auditing.
Step-by-Step Outline
Step 1: AI-Powered Document Verification
Build a Document Verification Model:

Document Classification: Use an AI model (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras) to classify documents by type (e.g., contract, diploma, certificate).
Document Integrity: Use NLP to check for standard fields (e.g., issuer, date, signatures).
Preprocess the document: Ensure correct orientation, remove noise using OpenCV.
Code for AI Model: Here’s a basic AI-based document classifier using TensorFlow:
